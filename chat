This is Zk id example I presented in the workshop
https://github.com/Lightprotocol/program-examples/tree/main/zk/zk-id

The zk id example uses Light Protocol to:

1. Compressed Addresses to create cheap nullifiers
2. store zk id credentials in existing Merkle trees indexed by Solana Rpcs
- you can use cheap nullifiers without 2 and vice versa


Cat | Solana Foundation, [14 Jan 2026 at 14:23:56]:
can we create our own arbitrary merkle tree and do inclusion proofs?


Jorrit - Light Protocol, [14 Jan 2026 at 15:27:02]:
you can create new zk compression State Merkle trees but it doesn't yield an advantage over using initialized ones.

For non zk compression sparse Merkle trees I would just create them directly in my program.

This is a sparse Merkle tree library that works with Solana Poseidon syscalls https://docs.rs/light-sparse-merkle-tree

Hello, could you please confirm if this integration of Light Protocol is a  mandatory requirement to submit in the open track?


Cat | Solana Foundation, [14 Jan 2026 at 15:50:50]:
No, but $3k of the total $18k is only for people who build on Light Protocol

i’m building on v2 trees. when do you guys plan to deploy on mainnet?

Hi team 👋
I’m building Cipher Pay, a private payment-link app on Solana.

Right now I’m using client-side encrypted memos for coordination, but i want to move toward proper ZK-based privacy.

I wanted to ask: Do you have a TypeScript SDK or any example repo that shows shielded transfers using ZK Compression?

More specifically, I’m trying to create a shielded payment link where:

👉the sender can fund the link privately, and

👉the receiver can claim it privately, without linking identities on-chain.

Any pointers to docs, examples, or recommended approaches would help a lot. Thanks 🙏


Jorrit - Light Protocol, [21 Jan 2026 at 12:40:45]:
Hey, light protocol doesn’t natively support shielded transfers. It is infrastructure that makes it easier to build zk protocols on Solana such as shielded transfers.

You can use it to:
1. store your nullifiers without paying for rent exemption
2. Store utxo hashes in a Merkle tree without the need to run an indexer or create the Merkle tree accounts
3. both 1 & 2 work independently or together


Folarihn Top 🅱️oi, [21 Jan 2026 at 12:42:16]:
Thank you sorted it and will make use of this information also 

Appreciate the response.


infraboi, [23 Jan 2026 at 14:14:51]:
hey jorrit! is it okay if i private dm you!!


Jorrit - Light Protocol, [23 Jan 2026 at 14:15:28]:
Sure

hello, who is the point of contact for technical & developer questions about light protocol ?
